# Hi there, I'm Hezron 👋 
### Multiplatform Mobile & Full-stack Web Developer

I am a **Multiplatform Mobile & Full-stack Engineer** specializing in building high-performance, scalable applications. From **iOS Native** and **Modern Android (Jetpack Compose)** to **Serverless Backends**, I bridge the gap between **Clean Architecture** and intuitive user experiences. I focus on creating seamless digital products that are not only beautiful but also production-ready and architecturally sound.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Trafet (In Closed Testing)
**Trafet** is a high-performance **Map & Travel** assistant. It demonstrates a robust implementation of **Compose Multiplatform (CMP)** with a strong focus on shared business logic and reactive UI.

- 🧪 **Tech Stack**: Kotlin / Compose Multiplatform (KMP), Node.js Cloud Functions, and Firestore.
- 🏗️ **Architecture**: Strictly follows **Clean Architecture** (Domain, Data, and UI layers) with **ScreenModel** for state management.
- 🚦 **State Management**: Reactive UI powered by **StateFlow** and **SharedFlow**, ensuring a seamless 60fps experience.
- 📡 **Data Flow**: Implements **DTO to Domain model** mapping, fetching data from **Cloud Functions** (Node.js) which integrates with **Firestore** and **Google Routes API**.
- ⚙️ **Advanced Backend**: Utilizes **Google Cloud Tasks** for automated Firestore updates and triggered **Push Notifications**, ensuring reliable background processing.
- 📦 **Offline Capabilities**: Supports offline route and map viewing by caching critical data using **Kstore**.
- 💳 **Monetization**: Production-ready In-App Purchase (IAP) integration powered by **RevenueCat**.
- 🛠️ **Tools**: Android Studio, Xcode, VSCode, Figma, Git, SourceTree

> [!NOTE]
> **Trafet** is currently in **Closed Testing** to ensure the best user experience.
> - **Android:** [Request Beta Access](mailto:hezronel.dev@gmail.com?subject=Trafet%20Beta%20Access) (Please provide your Play Store email).
> - **iOS:** Slated for release following the Android phase.
